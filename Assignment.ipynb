    "\n",
    "The Route class represents a route using a singly linked list, where each waypoint is connected to the next waypoint in a linear fashion. It allows traversal of waypoints in a forward direction only. The BidirectionalRoute class extends the Route class by using a doubly linked list, enabling traversal in both forward and backward directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Route Tracker provides the following core functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "add_waypoint(location, description): This method adds a new waypoint to the end of the route. It creates a new Waypoint object with the given location and description and connects it to the existing waypoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "insert_waypoint_after(target, location, description): This method inserts a new waypoint after a specific target waypoint. It creates a new Waypoint object with the given location and description and updates the links to connect it to the neighboring waypoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "remove_waypoint(location): This method finds and removes a waypoint from the route based on its location. It updates the links of the neighboring waypoints to bypass the waypoint being removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "next_waypoint(): This method allows traversal to the next waypoint in a BidirectionalRoute. It moves the current waypoint reference forward by one and returns the new current waypoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "previous_waypoint(): This method allows traversal to the previous waypoint in a BidirectionalRoute. It moves the current waypoint reference backward by one and returns the new current waypoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the Route class provides a traverse_route() method that allows you to print the details of each waypoint in the route, facilitating the visualization and examination of the entire route.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Route Tracker, implemented through the Route and BidirectionalRoute classes, offers the ability to manage and manipulate sequences of waypoints, supporting operations such as adding, inserting, removing, and traversing the waypoints in a defined order."
